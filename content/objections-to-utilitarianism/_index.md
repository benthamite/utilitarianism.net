Utilitarianism is a very controversial moral theory. Critics have raised many objections against it, and its defenders have responded with attempts to defuse these objections.

In the following, we explain and address the most influential objections to utilitarianism.

## General Ways of Responding to Objections to Utilitarianism

Many objections rest on the idea that utilitarianism has counterintuitive implications. We can see these implications by considering concrete examples or _thought experiments_. For instance, in our article on the [rights objection](/objections-to-utilitarianism/rights), we consider the Transplant case:

> **Transplant:** Imagine a hypothetical scenario in which there are five patients, each of whom will soon die unless they receive an appropriate transplanted organ⁠—a heart, two kidneys, a liver, and lungs. A healthy patient, Chuck, comes into the hospital for a routine check-up and the doctor finds that Chuck is a perfect match as a donor for all five patients. Should the doctor kill Chuck and use his organs to save the five others?

At first glance, it seems that utilitarianism has to answer the question affirmatively. It is better that five people survive than that just one person does. But killing Chuck seems morally monstrous to many. This apparent implication of utilitarianism is taken as an argument against its being the correct moral theory.

Proponents of utilitarianism can respond to its apparent counterintuitive implications in four general ways.

First, they can _accommodate_ the intuition that seems to conflict with utilitarianism by arguing that a sophisticated application of utilitarian principles avoids the counterintuitive implication. To more reliably promote good outcomes, sophisticated utilitarians recognize their cognitive limitations and [act in accordance with commonsense norms and heuristics](/utilitarianism-and-practical-ethics/#respecting-commonsense-moral-norms), other than in exceptional circumstances. Insofar as an objector merely claims that we should embrace or oppose certain norms _in practice_, utilitarians can often straightforwardly agree.

Second, utilitarians can attempt to _debunk the moral intuition_ invoked by a particular case by suggesting that it resulted from an unreliable process.[^2] If a [debunking argument](/arguments-for-utilitarianism#evolutionary-debunking-arguments) succeeds, the targeted moral intuition should not be given much weight in our moral reasoning.

Third, proponents of utilitarianism can _attack the available alternatives_—such as deontological or virtue ethical theories—to show that they have [implications no less counterintuitive than those of utilitarianism](/arguments-for-utilitarianism#the-poverty-of-the-alternatives).

A fourth strategy is to _tolerate_ the intuition, which is sometimes called “biting the bullet”. This is to accept that utilitarianism has counterintuitive implications but to hold on to the theory because all-things-considered it is still more plausible than its rivals. The costs of accepting a counterintuitive implication, it is argued, can be outweighed by the force of [the arguments in favor of utilitarianism](/arguments-for-utilitarianism). Moreover, our intuitions are often inconsistent and they are subject to change over time, which makes it impossible to find consistent and plausible principles that reflect all of them. So it requires good judgment to determine which intuitions and theoretical commitments are non-negotiable, and which we should be willing to compromise on in pursuit of “[reflective equilibrium](/arguments-for-utilitarianism#introduction-moral-methodology-amp-reflective-equilibrium)”, or the most plausible and coherent overall combination of moral verdicts and principles.

## The Utilitarian's Toolkit

There are further arguments that utilitarians may appeal to in developing the above general strategies.

- The distinction between utilitarianism's [_criterion of rightness_ and its _recommended decision procedure_](/types-of-utilitarianism#multi-level-utilitarianism-versus-single-level-utilitarianism) is crucial to utilitarian attempts to _accommodate_ common intuitions. Given that [“rightness” is not the central concept of utilitarian theory](/types-of-utilitarianism/#reconstructing-rightness-maximizing-satisficing-and-scalar-utilitarianism), it may well make more sense to interpret common intuitions about “right” and “wrong” as addressing the question of what norms we should endorse in practice, rather than what ideally ought to be done in principle. If justified, this interpretative move can drastically reduce the apparent conflict between utilitarianism and commonsense moral intuitions.
- More generally, utilitarians may seek to reduce their apparent conflict with commonsense by _identifying nearby intuitions_ that they _can_ accommodate. For example, if critics claim that a specific welfare-maximizing action is intuitively _wrong_, utilitarians may argue that our intuition here is better thought of tracking one of the following features:

  - that it would be good to _inculcate practical norms_ against actions of that type;
  - that the action is _reckless_, or plausibly wrong _in expectation_, even if it happens to turn out for the best;
  - that a person willing to perform such an action would likely have _bad character_, and be likely to cause greater harms on other occasions.
- Rival moral theories may be undermined by appeal to the [veil of ignorance](/arguments-for-utilitarianism#the-golden-rule-the-veil-of-ignorance-and-the-ideal-observer), and the related idea of _ex ante Pareto_—or what it would be in _everyone_'s best interests to agree to in advance (before learning about their particular position in life). Our intuitive reluctance to stick with the overall best policy can then start to seem [biased](/arguments-for-utilitarianism/#status-quo-bias).
- Deontology faces a dilemma between Absolutist and Moderate varieties. The former—prohibiting rule violations no matter how great the cost to overall well-being—seems implausibly extreme, but the latter risks arbitrariness due to lacking a clear account of where to draw the line. By contrast, utilitarianism offers a clear and principled account of when constraints can reasonably be violated—namely, just when doing so would best serve overall well-being.
- Some utilitarian verdicts seem objectionably demanding in ordinary circumstances, while still being less demanding than could plausibly be justified in wartime. But in fact our "ordinary circumstances" involve horrific amounts of [preventable suffering](/acting-on-utilitarianism#opportunities-to-help-others), with stakes as high as any war. Utilitarian verdicts may thus be bolstered by noting that much sentient life is (metaphorically) under siege, and that some moral heroism may accordingly be required to set things right.

We employ each of these arguments, where appropriate, to respond to the specific objections listed below. (Students are encouraged, when reading an objection, to anticipate how to apply the utilitarian’s toolkit to address the objection at hand.)
