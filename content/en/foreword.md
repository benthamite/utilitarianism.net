This introduction to utilitarianism appears at a propitious moment. Not since the Philosophical Radicals, inspired by Jeremy Bentham, campaigned to extend voting rights and reform prisons in the early nineteenth century has utilitarianism attracted as much public attention as it does today, nor has it ever been as prominent in discussions of ethics among teachers and researchers of philosophy.  Even in its nineteenth century heyday, however, utilitarianism was widely ridiculed, and the reforms urged by leading utilitarians were vehemently opposed. Conservative defenders of the status quo succeeded in delaying, for several decades, reforms such as votes for women, the legalization of same-sex relationships, medical aid in dying, and laws to adequately protect the welfare of animals. In some countries that opposition continues to block changes that would contribute to reducing suffering. Nevertheless, thinking that is broadly utilitarian, even if not explicitly so, is having greater worldwide impact than it has ever had before.

That impact became apparent when the Covid-19 pandemic swept the world in 2020. Governments almost everywhere, faced with a new virus for which there was, at first, no vaccine, instituted lockdowns – that is, laws, regulations, or executive orders that deprived their citizens of the rights to freedom of movement and freedom of association, and curtailed their religious freedom by making it illegal for them to worship together.  Did the citizens rise up, proclaiming that these rights are sacrosanct, and not to be overridden by the goal of achieving the most well-being for all?  No. Overwhelmingly they accepted and supported the suppression of these rights for the greater good.  They may not have conceived of this greater good as sweepingly as utilitarians do – they may have been moved by concerns for their own good, or the good of their parents, children or other loved ones – but their governments usually did profess to be acting for the greater good of the community as a whole.  That was as true of the United States, a country that began with a declaration of a supposedly self-evident and unalienable right to liberty, as it was of countries like the United Kingdom or Australia that lack such founding statements.  When it came to the crunch, rights yielded to the calculus, based on the best available evidence in that situation of uncertainty, of what government action would bring about the greatest benefit.  This is exactly what utilitarians would do.

Several other twenty-first century changes in ethical thinking and practice, consistent with utilitarian views, have overcome the opposition of institutions that follow inflexible non-utilitarian ethical doctrines, especially hardline religious teachings. During the past two or three decades, we have seen major shifts in public morality on issues like same-sex relationships, culminating, in several countries in the legalization of homosexual marriage and of voluntary euthanasia or medically assisted dying, allowing those who are terminally ill to die peacefully at a time of their own choosing, without further suffering.  The movement to protect animals from suffering has also gained strength, and as utilitarians would urge, is increasingly - though still insufficiently - focused on reducing the vast quantity of suffering we inflict on billions of intensively confined chickens and pigs, rather than on the much smaller number of abused dogs and cats.

The newest example and perhaps most promising example of the influence of utilitarian thinking is the effective altruism movement, which began in the first decade of the present century. It is a social movement and a philosophical outlook that emphasizes doing the most good we can, with the resources we have available, for all sentient beings, whether they are close at hand or on the other side of the planet, and whether they are living now or are yet to be conceived. As effective altruism is covered very well in the following pages, there is no need for us to say more about it here.

Utilitarianism, then, is an ethical view whose time has come, with the opportunity to do far more good than it has ever done. It remains contested. To make up our minds about it, we need to start by stating clearly what it is, with its main varieties set out, and the reasons for holding or rejecting these varieties examined.  Utilitarianism’s very plausible answer to the question “What should we strive to promote?” is “well-being,” but what is well-being?  Is it happiness, understood as pleasure or desirable states of consciousness?  Is it the satisfaction of our preferences, whatever they may be?  Or are some things objectively good for us, even if we don’t care about them?  All these questions are discussed, thoughtfully and clearly, in the book you are now reading.

Before we conclude, we want to mention two unusual aspects of this work.  The first is that it is written by three authors, two of them, at least, disagree about which is the best moral theory. Richard Chappell tells us that, like the classical utilitarians, Bentham, Mill and Sidgwick, he considers that the right action is the one that has the best consequences - in other words that consequentialism (the genus of which classical utilitarianism is the best-known species) is true. He parts from that trio, however, in rejecting the view that the only intrinsic good, and hence the only consequences that matter, is pleasure, which means that he is not a hedonist. Will MacAskill, on the other hand, thinks that hedonism offers the most plausible account of which consequences matter, but has doubts about whether the right action is always the one that has the best consequences.  We will put our cards on the table too: we are consequentialists and hedonists, so we differ from both Chappell and MacAskill, and agree with Bentham, Mill and Sidgwick, but especially with Sidgwick, whose book _The Methods of Ethics_ we rank as possibly the best ever written on ethics.[^1]

The unusual feature of this book that we like best, however, is that it does not treat utilitarianism only as a theory, as so many books on ethics treat the ideas they present, but also as a live option for each of us to choose as a philosophy that guides our life.  The presence of the chapter on what it is like to live as a utilitarian indicates something uniquely important about ethics, but often neglected. Studying ethics can change your life.
