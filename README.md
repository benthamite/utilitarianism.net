- Using *Hugo*

### Internationalization

In the future we may want to use some `rtl` support
```
{{ cond (eq $.Site.Language.LanguageDirection "rtl") "pl4-l" "pr4-l" }}
```

#### Notes
We can generate the table of contents manually:

- Using *Markdown All In One* - https://markdown-all-in-one.github.io/docs/guide/table-of-contents.html
  - Install and run "Create Table of Contents"
  - Update `toc.updateOnSave` to "no" after first time maybe

But it's now generated by Hugo automatically if we add the shortcode `{{< TOC >}}`
